    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Companies increasingly turn to platform engineering to help scale their development teams and increase developer experience for engineer efficiency. But how do platforms work? Who should build them? Is platform engineering overly focused on technology, or is it about people? In this virtual panel, we’ll discuss how teams build platforms, set others up for success, work with developers who use their platform, measure their progress, and adapt to new challenges.
      We’ll examine platforms from the perspective of developer experience and explore how leading companies are helping their engineers avoid bottlenecks and friction. While there will be many stories of how things went well, expect a few tales of unexpected trouble and bumps in the road, too.

            Platforms allow developers to focus and spend more time developing business logic and product features instead of wasting time writing infrastructure components and implementing non-functional requirements.
          </li>
          <li style="font-size: small;">
            Platforms provide development automation, easier use of technologies and integrations, removal of dependencies and handoffs for developers, and productivity gains.
          </li>
          <li style="font-size: small;">
            Organizations engage their developers to ensure platform adoption through training, internal open-source approaches, guilds, chat-based support, frequent meetings, and getting feedback.
          </li>
          <li style="font-size: small;">
            Loss of freedom for developers and establishing related business priorities are some of the main hurdles in platform adoption. Work closely with your developers to build something that helps them do their work better.
          </li>
          <li style="font-size: small;">
            To measure the impact of their platforms, companies use developer surveys, adoption metrics, measuring velocity, and metrics from DORA.
          </li>
          <li style="font-size: small;">
            For effective platform implementation, consider building one unified platform, component-based adoption, including the developer’s toolchain, making developers part of the golden path, and avoiding enforcing adoption.
           </li>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Aviran Mordo</strong>: "Back in 2010, when we started to learn how to do CI/CD, we realized that we wanted more than just automation. We wanted to give our developers the best experience we could think of for managing their artifacts."</p>
        <p>"In 2011, we fully adopted microservices architecture and figured out CI/CD methodology, so we set up to build the first platform and developer’s portal."</p>
        <p>"A few years later, we looked at our developer’s velocity and took yet another step in Platform Engineering. We took the abstraction to a higher level, from the infrastructure level to the code level, and built Platform as a Runtime, which spans from the code level all the way down the stack to the infrastructure level."</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
          <strong>Jemma Hussein Allen</strong>:
          "The organizations I have worked in started to build their platforms around 5–10 years ago. Initially, the platforming initiatives started when we migrated workloads from on-premise to virtual machines in the cloud. Once containerized workloads became more widely adopted, we migrated from either on-premise to containerized cloud-based workloads or from virtual machine cloud-based workloads to containerized ones."</p>
